# Regression-Models

In these projects, I used various regression models on a dataset to predict the salary of different company positions, testing which model fit the data the best! 

Through this project, I learned how to develop: 

*Polynomial Regressions
*Support Vector Regressions
*Decision Tree Regression
*Random Forest Regression

An executable .py file can be found for each model, along with a .ipynb file to visualize the model's results on the dataset. Additionally, the dataset is attached.

To speed up model training, Google Colab was used.

These projects were completed through a course on Udemy in July 2023 but were only added to GitHub recently.
